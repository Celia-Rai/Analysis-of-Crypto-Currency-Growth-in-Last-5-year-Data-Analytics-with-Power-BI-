Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesnâ€™t rely on banks for every transaction. It's a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Cryptocurrencies exist only in digital form and can be transferred completely between digital addresses. This means that any legal rights associated with holding cryptocurrencies must be different despite it being remaining open to interpretation. In this project we look at the various treatments of money in the legal sense and discuss the risks associated with each by drawing on real life examples.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have matured from being associated exclusively with techies and radicals to being considered by central banks as a technology to implement  digital money.The project will also contribute to the broader goal of digital payment system, promoting efficiency, innovation, and customer-centricity.
